### About Us

At **ChemEonix**, we operate at the intersection of deep scientific principles and high-performance software engineering. Our mission is to translate complex chemical research and data into scalable, intelligent, and user-centric SaaS products. We leverage expertise in computational chemistry, machine learning, and full-stack development to build automated, high-throughput platforms that accelerate scientific discovery.

### Our Technology Philosophy

We are committed to building robust, maintainable, and scalable systems by adhering to modern best practices.

-   **Architecture**: We employ a component-driven, services-oriented architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between our frontend interfaces and backend logic.
-   **Tech Stack**: Our core stack includes **Next.js** with TypeScript for the frontend and containerized **FastAPI** services in Python for the backend. We rely on **PostgreSQL** for data persistence and leverage tools like **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Vercel** for seamless CI/CD and deployment.
-   **Quality & Collaboration**: Code quality is paramount. We enforce strict linting and formatting standards and utilize modern development tools like GitHub Copilot, configured with project-specific instructions to ensure consistency and accelerate development.

### Our Ventures

This organization hosts the source code for all ChemEonix ventures, from foundational R&D projects to full-fledged commercial applications.

-   **[portfolio-hub](https://github.com/ChemEonix/portfolio-hub)**: The central portfolio and digital identity for our founder, Dr. Travis B. Mitchell.
-   _(More ventures coming soon...)_
