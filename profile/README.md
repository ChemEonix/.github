### Mission: Beyond Pattern Recognition
**ChemEonix** is the independent R&D portfolio of **Travis B. Mitchell, Ph.D.**, created to explore how causal and explainable AI can deepen our understanding of chemistry, materials, and other complex scientific systems.

Modern machine learning excels at recognizing correlations—but genuine innovation demands insight into *why* things happen.  
ChemEonix projects aim to bridge that gap by integrating scientific reasoning with AI and software engineering to reveal the causal mechanisms behind observed data.

---

### Focus Areas
- **Molecular & Materials Informatics** – data-efficient and explainable ML for small-data chemistry  
- **Causal & Generative Modeling** – uncovering structure–property relationships  
- **Scientific Software Systems** – robust, modular tools built with modern full-stack practices  
- **Applied Research Automation** – connecting theory, computation, and experimentation through software  

---

### Technical Philosophy
ChemEonix emphasizes maintainability and reproducibility in scientific software:

- **Architecture** – component-driven, service-oriented design separating frontend and backend logic  
- **Stack** – Next.js (Typescript) frontend; containerized FastAPI (Python) backend; PostgreSQL persistence  
- **Quality** – linting, type safety, CI/CD (Docker + GitHub Actions + Vercel/Azure) to ensure professional reliability  

---

### Current Work
This organization hosts code and experiments developed as part of Travis Mitchell’s independent research, including:

- **chemeonix-website** — portfolio and technical showcase  
- **molrep-assessor** — open project benchmarking molecular representation quality for AI models  
- *Additional exploratory tools and datasets forthcoming*
